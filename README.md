# Pyxyne's Protohackers solutions

Each file is named based on which problem it solves (p0_echo, p1_prime, etc.). Older versions of the solutions are in the `old` folder, with a suffix for each iteration (`_v1`, `_v2`, etc.).

Most solutions are in Python, and use a common framework defined in the "lib_*.py" files. Problem 0 also has a C++ solution (compiled with g++ 11.2). Problem 9 is in D (compiled with DUB v1.30.0, DMD v2.101.0).

Solutions were tested on Ubuntu 22.04, with Python 3.10 and no third-party libraries. I make no guarantee that they run on older versions. They also probably don't work on non-Linux OSes.
