# Pyxyne's Protohackers solutions

Each file is named based on which problem it solves (p0_echo, p1_prime, etc.), and sometimes a suffix if there are multiple solutions.

Most solutions are in Python, and use a common framework defined in the "lib_*.py" files. Python 3.10 is known to work, some earlier versions may as well. No third-party libraries are required.

The first problem also has a C++ solution, which should be pretty easy to compile on a Linux machine. No libraries or special compiler options required.
